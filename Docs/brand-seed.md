# Pical Brand Seed — "Quietly Helpful Companion"

## Palette
| Name | Hex | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dawn Feather | `#F5F1EB` | App background, cards, agenda canvas |
| Ink Wing | `#1F1B2E` | Primary text, icons |
| Meadow Sage | `#8BAA7D` | Accents for active elements, selection |
| Iridescent Plum | `#B68BD6` | Highlights for important bars, CTA focus |
| Ember Gold | `#F6C56E` | Friendly warnings, upcoming reminders |

## Typography
- **Display / Headlines:** SF Rounded (iOS native) with tight leading
- **Body:** SF Pro Text, 15pt base, 1.25 line-height
- **Numerics:** Tabular for timestamps for easier scanning

## Voice & Microcopy Principles
1. **Warm brevity.** Prefer invitations over commands: “Let’s add this” instead of “Add event”.
2. **Curiosity cues.** Sprinkle bird references sparingly: “Nest it for later?” when deferring.
3. **Assurance over urgency.** Replace red warning states with Ember Gold nudges.
4. **Context-first reminders.** Every reminder speaks to the why: “Sketch Pical bars before lunch?”

## Motion & Interaction
- Agenda rows slide gently from the top (200ms) with a slight ease-out curve.
- Horizontal bars should “grow” from left to right when created, mimicking a feather unfurling.
- Use subtle haptics on add/edit confirmation.

## Sounding Board Prompts
- "Does this feel like a calm companion perched nearby?"
- "Would someone open this without dread at 6am?"
- "Can a single glance explain the day without scrolling?"

## Icon Seeds
- Outline of a magpie tail integrated into the Pical "P".
- Small circular glyph showing sunrise → midday → dusk gradient for future widgets.

## Next Experiments
- Create SwiftUI color assets for palette above.
- Explore a monotone illustration of a magpie carrying an event card for onboarding.
- Prototype friendly reminder copy deck (10 examples) and rotate via config.
